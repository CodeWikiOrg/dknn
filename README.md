DkNN is a version of the well-known supervised classification algorithm k-Nearest Neighbours, with a slight twist that allows for the algorithm to be deployed on devices with scarce hardware resources.


## Features

- Updates dilution parameters and class centers.
- Calculates for a data point, distance per class center.
- Monitors overconfidence circles of classes.
- Does DkNN classification on data.
- Drops incomplete batches.
